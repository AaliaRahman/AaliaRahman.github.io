# Coder Girl Web Cohort
## Personal Website

The purpose of this repository is to get you your personal website up on GitHub Pages!

## Getting Started

1. Create a GitHub account. For this tutorial, we'll pretend you picked the name GitHubUsername. If you already have an account, sign in and continue to step 2.
2. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
3. Once it finishes forking to your account, go to Settings and change the **Repository name** to GitHubUsername.github.io where GitHubUsername is the username you picked in step 1.
4. Scroll down to **GitHub Pages** and change the **Source** from **None** to **master branch**
5. It can take up to 15 minutes for your website to show up on https://GitHubUsername.github.io, but it'll be there if you are patient.

## What now

Really make this website your own:

* Fill in the missing information with your information
* replace the thumbnail with a picture of yourself
* change the colors to match your style and personality
* You will always be able to come back and make more additions to this webpage as you learn new things.
