        Who are you? What are you interested in? What are you doing to learn to code?
        Hi, This is Aalia. What I'm interested in is a really broad question. I guess I like animals, art, poetry, design and so much more you probably don't care about.
        I am part of this program called CoderGirl Winter Cohort that is allowing me to make sure that I can become an awesome developer. He he!
