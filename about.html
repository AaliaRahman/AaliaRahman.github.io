      <h3>Aalia graduated with a degree in Studio art with an emphasis in Painting and Graphic Design from Saint Louis University in May 2014, allowing her to learn new techniques, while switching her form of painting from realism to surrealistic expressionism. Aalia has exhibited her artwork at art shows locally as well as internationally. In 2014, she exhibited her artwork at the All India Contemporary Art Exhibition in India and was published at their local e-zine. Earlier in 2015, she won the Special Recognition Award from Light, Space and Time Online Gallery and the Award of Excellence from Four Points Contemporary, while working as a resident artist at MindWorks Gallery at Chesterfield Mall. Recently, Aalia was part of the group show at the St. Louis Bread Co. Cares Cafe in Clayton.<br><br>
        Through her digital medium, Aalia has interned at Yellow Brick Creative Studio and in 2015 was chosen as one of five finalists for the International Al Jazeera Community Challenge for her infographic on clinical depression. Having worked for several local nonprofits including Diversity Awareness Partnership, Muslim Women's Professional Network and currently Consuming Kinetics Dance Company, Aalia has a firm understanding of the nonprofit work environment. Aalia currently freelances for clients across the country, primarily in the education, healthcare, and nonprofit sectors.<br><br>
        Besides artwork, Aalia writes poetry, advocates for animal rights and reads nonfiction.</h3>
